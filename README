The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

sigrok-cli is a command-line tool written in C, which uses both libsigrok
and libsigrokdecode to provide the basic sigrok functionality from the
command-line. Among other things, it's useful for scripting purposes.
